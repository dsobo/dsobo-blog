Today I christen my first attempt to join the online data science discourse by starting my very own blog. My goal is to write a data science/R blog in layman’s terms so others can easily follow each project or concept I discuss. I choose this tone not because I am a master at synthesizing complex concepts into easy to understand common language, but because I don’t understand the complexity well enough to describe it in sciency terms. As such, this blog will be a healthy dose of trial and error, scouring google for answers, and hitting dead ends, which incidentally is the only way I learn things these days. If you are familiar with the blogs of the big hitters in the R development community, this is not going to be one of those blogs. I do not have PhD in statistics from Iowa State and I am not literally writing the Bookdown on some esoteric concept in statistics or R software. Also, in response to the judgement and eyerolls my online digital avatar felt as “real developers” read this is an R blog, I DON’T CARE AND I JUST WANT TO DO COOL STUFF.

At last year’s R Studio Conference, I attended the Advanced R Markdown workshop and learned about all the amazing packages developed by Yihui Xie and company to create reproducible reports, presentations, and online materials. I immediately declared I would never open word, PowerPoint, Visio, or any other presentation tool ever again and embrace the R Markdown ecosystem entirely. I planned to have a Blogdown website up and running by the end of the weekend. Fast forward 8 month: I have no blog and completely succumbed to the ease and familiarity of PowerPoint. I’d bet this story is familiar to many R users who are out there and trying to find a place in the data science world. Whether it’s mastering Blogdown or even using git regularly, I find the below accurate describes my R 
development lifecycle.

```{r diagram, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align="center"}

grViz("
  digraph {

graph [layout = circo,
       splines = curved]


node [fontname = Helvetica,
      shape = plaintext,
      style = filled,
      color = palegreen]
      
E [label = 'Common R Development \n Lifecycle', style = '']
A [label = 'Learn something awesome at RConf; \n become inspired']
B [label = 'Pledge to master R and \n become next Hadley']
C [label = 'Set aside time to develop in R. \n Make little progress']
D [label = 'Life gets busy. \n Weeks pass without opening R. \n Forget all progress made']


#Edge Definitions

A -> B -> C -> D -> A} 
}")

Are you competent but not a master at scripting in R? Are you ok at functional programming but still not super comfortable with it? DO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TIDY EVAL IS OR WHY YOU SHOULD KNOW IT?  If this sounds familiar, then you might just be in the right place! Follow me as I try to buck the trend of stagnation and non-productivity. I will set lofty goals, struggle to make progress, and maybe learn something (probably not tidy eval) along the way. If I am the only one who ever reads this, it will be worth it for the sole fact that I have already learned how to embed gifs into markdown files and for that…
