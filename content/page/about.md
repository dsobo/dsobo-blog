## Hi, I’m Dennis.


Like many out there, I was faced with the monumental decision of deciding my life’s trajectory as I entered college: a time when I was more concerned with what I was doing that weekend than 4 years in the future. Luckily, I happened to go to the #1 business school in the country, which made it easy to shrug my shoulders and say, “I guess I’ll be a business major”. It was only until years later, after graduation and a stint in the world of finance, that I realized 18 year old me should have never been entrusted to make such an important decision. 

This is not to say I didn’t learn valuable lessons and make lifelong friends during the journey, but I craved more tangible skills outside of the Excel spreadsheet and #CubeLife. I did learn, after dangerously teaching myself SQL on my company’s production database, that I have a real interest in data analysis and its related technologies. I hit the redo button and pursued a Master’s in Data Analytics degree in 2016 to level up my skills.

I quickly realized that these types of programs are what you make of them. Many of my classmates were perfectly happy proofreading group project papers, shaking hands at networking events, and avoiding learning any kind of programming language, as long as they got their slip of paper in the end saying they had a graduate degree. I never understood why they would pay all that money to learn as little as possible. I decided to dive headfirst into R and have been learning all I can in the realm of data science ever since. I scour blogs, articles, and Github repositories to expand my data knowledge. RStudio Conference has become a yearly pilgrimage where I kneel at the altar of data and learn from some of the greatest minds in the data science community. As Marshawn Lynch famously coined before Superbowl XLIX, when it comes to data “I’m just ‘bout that action boss”. 

Now, I am an analytics specialist at BlueTree, a healthcare consulting firm specializing in organizations using the Epic electronic medical record software. Healthcare is prime for a data revolution: most organizations have invested huge sums of money to capture data at every step in a patient’s journey. Almost all still need to take advantage of their hard earned data to fully meet the value proposition that electronic medical records present. Everyday I try to apply data science techniques I’ve learned to the real world scenarios that hospitals see. I even write some blog posts about it on our company website.(add link)

This site is meant to be equal parts portfolio, creative outlet, information repository for future reference, and learning motivation. Simply learning to create this website and have it directly connected to my Github repository has been worth the effort so far. Everything else I learn I consider icing on the cake. I tend to learn through struggle, which there is sure to be plenty of in future posts. Join me on my data journey as I try to become the best data scientist I can be.
